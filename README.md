# Crowd-Emotion-Recognition

Emotion Detection is a very improtant problem in the domain of advertisement as it can help the advertisement agency for choosing what to advertise during any occasion.

This project was aimed to develop a machine learning model for for emotion detection using Convolution Neural Network. The model conatisn 2 components.

1. Facenet: This componnet is a pretrained model for finding the faces in the images and generate bounding box coordiantes.
2. Emotion Classifier: It takes the croped bounding box images as input and them perform emotion detection on the image to identify 7 emotions().
